## Overview
The goal of this project is to build the most accurate classification machine learning model in order to detect faulty wafers in semiconductor manufacturing process. The dataset that is being utilised for this project is the SECOM Dataset which comes from the UCI machine learning repository. 
 

> The cross-industry standard process (CRISP-DM) framework was utilised to plan, organise and implement the Fault Detection Models
