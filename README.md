# Semiconductor Manufacturing ~ Fault-Detection
<hr/>

The goal of this project is to build a classification machine learning model in order to detect faulty wafers in semiconductor manufacturing process. The dataset that is being utilised in this project SECOM Dataset which comes from the UCI machine learning repository. The cross-industry standard process (CRISP-DM) framework was employed to implement this particular project.
